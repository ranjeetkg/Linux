Note:- 1Block=1KB

Id is used by system to identify the type of partition.
* means it is a boot partiton.

>> How to create new partition:-
# fdsik < device name >
# fdisk /dev/hda
command(m for help):
commands are:-

p print partition table
t set system id(tag)
w to save and quit
q to quit without saving
m prints this help
l to list system id

first cyl..........: (press enter)
size in mb +sizeM..: +100M
command(m for help): w
it will display warning:- kernel use old partition table.
# partprobe /dev/hda
now check partition:-
# fdisk -l

>> How to delete partition:-
first note the partition no. by using 'fdisk -l' command.
for example----/dev/hda9
then,
# fdisk /dev/hda
command(m for help) : d
partition no.(1-9) : 9
command(m for help) : w

Note:- dont delete partition already created, delete only that partition which u hav created.

>> How to format partition:-
mkfs command is used to make file system.

To format partition using ext3 file system:-
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda9

To format partition using ext2 file system:-
# mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda9

To format partition using vfat file system:-
# mkfs.vfat /dev/hda9
How to mount the formated partition:-

mount command is used to create a link between physical partition and an empty directory.

you can use /mnt directory for mounting any partition or you can create your own dir. also
# mount <device name+partition no.> < mount point>
# mount /dev/hda9 /mnt
# mount /dev/hda10 /cms
after mounting you can create file/dir in that partition:-
# cd /mnt
# touch 1 2 3 4
# mkdir one two three four

mount command is also used to check whether the partition is mounted or not
# mount (press enter)
it will show all currrently mounted partitions

Label:- label of partition is name of partition
(ex. in windows .....disk1_vol1, localdisik)
(ex. in linux ..... /boot, /root)

How to check current label:
# e2label < partition no. >
# e2label /dev/hda1
# e2label /dev/hda2

>>how to change label:
# e2label /dev/hda9 Myname
# e2label /dev/hda10 yourname

>>How to convert ext2 to ext3
# tune2fs -j /dev/hda9

>>How to convert ext3 to ext2
# tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/hda9
(capital O)
