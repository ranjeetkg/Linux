SWAP --> swap is a file system, it is similar to virtual memory of windows, swap space is used to improve the system performance.

>> How swap works?
system identifies the idle process in RAM(memory) and sends it to swap space, so that RAM again becomes free. Swap space is created on Hard disk

>> Rule to create Swap?
if size of RAM < 2GB
then size of SWAP=2*RAM
else
size of SWAP= 2 + RAM

>>How to view info about swap
# free
# more /proc/meminfo
# more /proc/swaps
# swapon -s

-s option is to show swap

>>How to increase Swap size
1. first create a new partition using fdisk command
ex. /dev/hda9
2. make it a swap partition:-
# mkswap /dev/hda9
3. enable swap on this partition:-
# swapon /dev/hda9
check it by using 'swapon -s'
