User Group Administration

whenever a user is created in linux :-
*its home directory is created(/home/username)
*its mail box is created(/var/spool/mail)
*unique UID & GID are given to user
*UID for system users 0 to 499
*UID for normal users 500 to 60,000

Redhat Enterprise Linux and fedora used UPG scheme
UPG... User Private Group

it means that whenever a user is created is has its own private group
how to create user:
syntax. # useradd <option> <username>
options are
-u user id
-G Secondary group id
-g primary group id
-d home directory
-c comment
-s shell
ex. # useradd user1
user1 is created
ex. # useradd -u 1001 -d /anydirectory -s /bin/sh user2
user2 is created with uid=1001,home=/anydirectory,shell=/bin/sh

All of user information is stored in /etc/passwd file.
it contains 7 fields:-
user1:x:500:500::/home/user1:/bin/bash
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 user login name
2 mask password
3 uid
4 gid
5 comments( bydefault no comment)
6 user's home directory
7 user's login shell

after creating users we can modify its properties by using:
syntax. # usermod <options> <username>

options are:
all of the options which are used with useradd command and,
-l to change login name
-L to LOCK account
-U to UNLOCK account
ex. # usermod -l newname oldname
ex. # usermod -L newname
ex. # usermod -U newname
note:- when a account is locked it will show !(exclamation mark)
in

/etc/shadow file.

how to set password:
syntax. # passwd <username>
ex. # passwd user1
ex. # passwd root
*the password information is stored inside /etc/shadow file
*it contains encrypted password
*linux uses MD5 and DES algorithms for encrypting passwords
*MD5 Message Digest version 5
DES Data Encryption Standard
how to delete a user account:
syntax. # userdel <option> <username>
ex. # userdel user1
it will delete user1 but home directory will not be deleted
ex. # userdel -r user2
