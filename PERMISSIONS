PERMISSIONS:-

To see the present permission on any file:-
# ls -ld <filename>

permission are applied on three levels:-
>> owner or user level
>> group level
>> others level

access modes are of three types:
>> r read only
>> w write/edit/delete/append
>> x execute/run a command

access modes are different on file and directory file dir
>> r open the file 'ls' the contents of dir
>> w write,edit,append,delete file add/del/rename contents of dir
>> x to run a command/shell script to enter into dir using 'cd'

the output of ls -ld command shows following properties
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 54 15 march ..... file1.txt
-----
filetype+permission, links , owner, grp name of owner, size in bytes, date of modification, file name.


file types:-
- normal file
d directory
l link file(shortcut)
b block file(harddisk,floppydisk)
c character file(keyboard,mouse)

Permission can be set on any file/dir by two methods:-
1 absolute method(numbers)
2 symbolic method(ugo)

To set the permission on file/dir 'chmod' command is used
bydefault permissions on file and dir:-

permissions on file and dir:-
                  file       dir
root              644       755
normal user       664       775
here---
read=4
write=2
execute=1

how to set permission on file/dir:-
syntax. # chmod <permission> <file/dir name>
ex. # chmod 777 /file1.txt
or
# chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx /file1.txt
or
# chmod ugo=rwx /file1.txt
this command is used to give full permission to all.
ex. # chmod 000 /file.txt
or
# chmod u=-,g=-,o=- /file.txt
or
# chmod ugo=- /file.txt
this command is used to remove all permission.


note:- UMASK- is the number which is removed from default permission of file/dir.

Default umask of root user is 022
Default umask of unprivledged user is 002

for root user:-
                                      file                       dir
default perm.                         666                        777
subtract UMASK                       -022                        -022
Resulting perm.                       644                        755

for normal user:-
                                      file                       dir
def. perm.                             666                       777
subtract UMASK                         -002                      -002
Resulting perm.                         664                       775

Advanced Permissions:

There are 3 types of adv. permissions:
SUID ... userlevel
SGID ... Grouplevel
Sticky bit others level

To set advance permissions by using numeric method we use
suid = 4
sgid = 2
stickybit= 1
SUID:-
If suid is set on any command then any normal user can run
that command with privledges of root user
like, Defaultly ping command is having suid, so all users can
run that command but if suid is removed then 'permission denied'
